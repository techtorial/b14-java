    POSSIBLE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
     1-What is polymorphism?
       -->It is a different forms of object.(Poly-->Many morphism-->forms)
     2-What is dynamic and static polymorphism?
     *Dynamic PolyMorphism:Run Time -->Overriding -->Dynamic(Action)
     *Static PolyMorphism:Compile Time-->Overloading

     3-What is the difference between overloading and overriding? **(THE MOST COMMON)\
       OVERLOADING:
      -->public void overloading(int a)
      -->private void overloading(int a,String b)
      -->Overloading needs to happen in the same class
      -->Overloading methods can have final,static,private keyword.
      ***-->IT CHECKS THE METHOD SIGNATURE ONLY(NAME OF THE METHOD + PARAMETERS)
      **-->IT DOESN't CARE ABOUT RETURN TYPE AND ACCESS MODIFIERS

       OVERRIDING:
       -->Overriding needs to happen in different classes.(Parent-child relationship-->Extends,Implements)
       -->Overriding should have same method signature(Name,Return type + parameters)
       (Access modifiers should be same or more accessible)
       -->Overriding cannot have private,static,final keywords.
